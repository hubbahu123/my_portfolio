description:
    Based on the industry-famous paper on "The Real time Volumetric Cloudscapes of Horizon Zero Dawn",
    I've attempted to re-create this realistic approximation of light's interaction with clouds
    in Unity with custom HLSL shader code. Additionally, the Perlin and Worley 3D noise textures used
    in rendering the clouds were generated with compute shaders and a wrapper of C# UI to make setting
    parameters and generation easier.
