description:
    'Created for the Coded By: Kids Ctrl+Shift Competition, this site was
    awarded first place for its use of 3D and its goal in educating those about art.
    While coding-wise the site is relatively simple (it is a static frontend), the complexity
    comes from the 3D used throughout such as raymarching, and shader algorithm that
    is an alternative to rasterized rendering.'
